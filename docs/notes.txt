Future private functions:
- threadAddFollowupVote.php
- threadAddTags.php

None of the database tables in the core need to be sync'd to remote servers.
This information only pertains to this local server.

The tag*.php files have the ability to add history to the module history table, but 
have been removed as they are not needed for the artcatalog module.  If required
in the future, the history can be added back.
